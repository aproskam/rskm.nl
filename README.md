## rskm.nl

My personal portfolio website build with 🏎 SvelteKit framework, the Content is managed via Contentful and the hosting and deployment is done via Vercel 🚀

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## ToDo

1. Implement multiple sustainable web optimisations
   1. Replace as much as possible images with vectors
   2. Change to energy efficient colours
   3. Move to a Green Hosting party
2. Replace the Contentful REST API integration with GraphQL variant
3. Add TypeScript
4. Add some small micro animations
